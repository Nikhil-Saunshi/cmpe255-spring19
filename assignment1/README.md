# Assignment 1

You will be building a Yelp review classifier for our new ranking scheme:

- Neutral (reviews with keywords like fine, OK etc..)
- Positive (reviews with keywords like great, awesome etc..)
- Negative (reviews with keywords like bad, awful etc..)

You can use any type of classifications (binary or multi) to classify the review dataset given by [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)

## Requirements

You must use Scikit Learn library only for this assignment. You need to submit these scores for your classifier.

- Cross validation score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score

Finally, you need to compare your ranking against Yelp's 5-stars ranking and share the instances that are opposite output (Yelp gives 5-stars and you classifier gives negative) as well as same output.
