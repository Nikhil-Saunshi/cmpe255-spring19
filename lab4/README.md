# Lab 4

Try to build an even-number detector classifier for the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) from Scikit-Learn. You can use either binary classifer or multi-classifier.

Use [these code snippets](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/03_classification.ipynb) as your baseline.

Finally, try using KNeigbhorsClassifier and see accuracy increases.
